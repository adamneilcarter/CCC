<h2>How low can you go? Juice limbo with mainstream UK ciders</h2>


<p class="western" style="text-align: left;">Britain makes a very good claim at being the home of cider. The history is there (we've been making cider on these islands for at least as long as anyone else has on the mainland), the volume is there (we drink more cider per person than any other country in the world!) but there's something missing and it's of crucial importance, Quality.</p>
<p class="western">About 90% of the cider sold in the UK is made from just 35% apple juice**. That should be quite surprising to most cider drinkers but due to our current UK Customs &amp; Excise definition of cider (a surprisingly long document known as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-162-cider-production/excise-notice-162-cider-production">Notice 162</a>) it all just gets sold as cider, so long as it meets that minimum juice requirement.</p>
<p class="western">This issue with our legislation has been written about and discussed at length by various champions of quality cider. Check out these blog posts by <a href="https://craftynectar.com/blogs/blog/realcider-is-transparency-the-answer">Crafty Nectar</a> and <a href="https://www.beesononbeer.co.uk/the-blog/2018/2/27/rotten-to-the-core-an-analysis-of-uk-cider-tax">James Beeson</a> for starters.</p>
<p class="western">This post however is about how we ended up with the lowest legal juice content for cider in the world, set at just a measly 35%.</p>
<p class="western">This is going to get quite technical so please bear with me.</p>
<p class="western">As ever with business we start with money. Concentrated apple juice (from here on I'll just refer to this as concentrate) costs more than fresh apple juice. It costs money to convert juice to concentrate and so it necessarily costs more. But, concentrate has three big advantages for the industrial cider maker; 1) It can be stored indefinitely, 2) It can be shipped from other countries and 3) it can be over diluted with water to create more juice than it started out as. Points 1 and 2 are self explanatory but point 3 is the most relevant for this post.</p>
<p class="western">One litre of juice typically weighs 1050 grams (g), one litre of concentrate typically weighs 1350g, during the concentration process, water is removed from the juice leaving behind the sugar and other non watery stuff (hence it weighs more). But as you remove the water obviously the over all volume is reduced. So for every seven litres of juice you get just one litre of concentrate. Theoretically then, if I add six litres of water to my one litre of concentrate I'd be back where I started with seven litres of juice (reconstituted) each weighing 1050g. But, here's the loophole, juice is defined in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-162-cider-production/excise-notice-162-cider-production">notice 162</a> as weighing anything over 1035g per litre* so you can probably imagine what our industrious cider maker does when adding water to their concentrate...yep, they add nine litres of water instead of six giving them ten whole litres of juice weighing 1035g/l (legally defined as 100% juice)</p>
<p class="western">So now we've got a tank full of this "juice" but if fermented it would only give us a cider with 4.5% alcohol. That would technically be a 100% juice (from concentrate) cider, but would still be a touch too costly for our industrial cider maker to produce.</p>
<p class="western">The solution is to add sugar to the "juice" to allow the yeast to raise the alcohol (Chaptalizing). Sugar is cheaper than juice and if you add 182g of sugar per litre of "juice" you'll be able to produce a 100% juice (from concentrate) cider with an enormous 14% alcohol! Another benefit to the large scale producer of chaptalizing to this extent is storage space, 50'000 litres of 14% cider once diluted makes 140'000 litres of 5% cider. that means you can get away with just a third of the tank space required by a full juice producer.</p>
<p class="western">Nobody sells 14% cider of course, because our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-162-cider-production/excise-notice-162-cider-production">Notice 162</a> states that cider cannot be stronger than 8.4%, so what is actually done is that our cider maker once again turns on the hose and adds water back to the "cider" to bring the alcohol down to say 5% alcohol (a typical abv for mass produced UK ciders). Diluting the "100% juice, 14% alcohol cider" down to 5% abv means they need to add approximately 64 litres of water to every 36 litres of their "100% juice, 14%abv cider"...</p>
<p class="western">And there we have it, a 5% abv cider that legally conforms to UK legislation and will more than likely be sold as a premium / craft / quality cider depending on when they last redesigned their labels or bought a canning line.</p>
<p class="western">The fact of it is that if you thought 35% apple juice was a little slim, then consider this final bit of maths. If we ignore the 1035g/l* definition and return the concentrate back to it's original density then you're actually looking at an astonishing 26% juice.</p>
In light of this, who do you think sits around the table and decides what is and what isn't cider, in other words who has the most influence on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-162-cider-production/excise-notice-162-cider-production">Notice 162, </a>the cider maker using fresh juice, selling 100% juice cider or the cider maker using concentrate, selling 35% juice cider?
<p class="western">If you drink cider at all then you deserve better than that. Seek out the real stuff, I know it can be hard to spot when every cider on the shelf looks the same but honestly, read the label, the good cider makers don't keep their ingredients or processes a secret, in many ways it's the only tool they have to distinguish their cider from the fake stuff masquerading as cider on our shelves.</p>
Cheers and happy cider hunting!
<p class="western">*1035g/l was reportedly set as the minimum weight (or density) of juice to reflect traditional cider makers using early season apples which sometimes have a much lower sugar content than the later season apples. This makes sense, it would be absurd to say that juice pressed from an apple in August wasn't legally juice but the loophole that it's created for the industrial producers can't be ignored.</p>
<p class="western">**These figures are based on direct personal experience within the industry</p>


<h2>UK Cider ingredients</h2>


<h1 style="text-align: center;">Why we need compulsory ingredient labelling for cider in the UK</h1>

<h1 style="text-align: center;">(And why certain brands would need a much bigger label)</h1>

I’m firmly in the ever increasing camp of cider makers who believe we need to re-visit the UKs legal definition of cider before the industry ends up back were it was 20 years ago (appealing predominantly to underage drinkers and alcohol dependents).

The document in question is known as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-162-cider-production/excise-notice-162-cider-production">Notice 162 </a>and it defines for duty purposes what is and what isn't cider in this country. As it stands this definition allows for a cider made from just 35% reconstituted apple juice concentrate (discussed at length <a href="http://caledoniancider.com/uncategorized/how-low-can-you-go-juice-limbo-with-mainstream-uk-ciders/">here</a>) to sit quite comfortably beside a cider made from 100% fresh pressed apple juice, both sold under the generic term of cider.

All ciders are not made equal but if both of these hypothetical products sat side by side how would a cider drinker be able to tell the difference on a supermarket shelf? They may both be in very similiar packaging, they may even both be described as Craft or Premium Cider on the label along with various claims to authenticity and tradition. The answer would surely have to be, with great difficulty! After all there is absolutely no obligation to display ingredients on a cider produced for the UK market. If there was the two products could be told apart with relative ease.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cider A Ingredients: Water, Apple Juice (from concentrate).</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Cider B Ingredients: Apple Juice (not from concentrate)</strong></li>
</ul>
Now, I’ve assumed both these products are simple, apple based ciders with absolutely the bare minimum of ingredients. More typically on Cider A you might see;
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Cider A Ingredients. Water, Apple Juice (from concentrate), Glucose, Malic Acid (E296), Caramel (E150d), Carbon Dioxide, Sulphite (E220), Potassium Sorbate (E202)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
But do people really look at ingredients when buying a bottle of cider? I Mean most people have a genuine and perfectly legitimate belief that cider is made from apples. They would almost certainly be surprised to learn that cider (as defined by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-162-cider-production/excise-notice-162-cider-production">Notice 162</a> in the UK) can contain anything up 41 permitted ingredients, a list which begins with the mysteriously titled Acesulfame K and ends with the equally arcane Sunset Yellow...

Take a look at Section 26 of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-162-cider-production/excise-notice-162-cider-production">Notice 162</a> if you fancy reading the whole list in it’s original format or I’ve put together a table listing all permitted cider ingredients, I’ve also included a column for their uses since many of them aren’t that obvious from the title alone.

<p>So, as a starting point I think most people would agree that compulsory full ingredient labelling is a must. Selling a product made from anything up to 41 different ingredients and not letting the consumer know what they are is quite simply unfair. In fact of all these ingredients there is only a legal requirement to display Sulphite as an allergen or if there is any artificial sweetener present.

Wine is defined in the EU legislation as a “product obtained exclusively from the total or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes, whether or not crushed, or of grape must.

We’re some of way off yet but wouldn’t it be nice if cider made in the UK was <strong>ALWAYS</strong> a “product obtained exclusively from the total or partial alcoholic fermentation of fresh apples, whether or not crushed, or of apple juice”.

If nothing else the list of ingredients wouldn’t take up a sheet of A5 paper... </p>


<h2>What is Craft Cider?</h2>


<p>Ever since the term Craft landed on our shores from the US there’s been debate about what exactly the term may or may not mean to us here in the UK.

The US Brewers Association defines a craft brewer as 1) Small, 2) Traditional and 3) Independent. We have no equivalent recognised or accepted definition of craft beer in the UK which allows brands such as Fosters to align themselves with the term for marketing purposes. So there’s obviously something odd with the craft beer situation in the UK but increasingly we’re seeing the term craft applied to cider.

So in this post I’m wondering what this ambiguous and occasionally controversial term means to both cider drinkers and cider makers and what it <em>could</em> mean in the future.

<a href="img/fosters-150x150.jpg"><img class="wp-image-595" src="img/fosters-150x150.jpg" alt="" width="150" height="150"></a> Craft beer anyone?[/caption]

Now, while we don’t have an official definition of craft in the UK we do appear to have a kind of folk definition where there’s an expectation of higher quality at a higher price. The issue with a folk definition is that it doesn’t stop an opportunistic company from just putting their standard low quality product in a can / bottle with a colourful label, calling it craft and charging a higher price for it. The result then being that the customers’ perception of craft cider would be damaged to the point where craft cider becomes synonymous with overpriced cider. Just as it would if their first foray into craft beer resulted in them purchasing a rebranded, repackaged mass produced low standard beer with a colourful label and the word craft displayed prominently in the text.

To further confuse the UK cider drinker we have another term to deal with, Real Cider. Real Cider as defined by <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/about-cider-perry">CAMRA</a> (Campaign for Real Ale) goes as follows.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>◦The liquid content before fermentation must consist entirely of non-pasteurized apple.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>◦No apple juice concentrates to be used</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>◦Normally, only the sugar naturally available in the fruit should be used to cause fermentation, but in years when the level of natural sugar in the fruit is low, the addition of extraneous sugar to aid fermentation is acceptable.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong><em>Process</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>◦No pasteurization to take place during the production process.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>◦No added colourings to be used.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>◦No added flavourings to be used, except pure fruits, vegetables, honey, hops, herbs and spices, yet no concentrates, cordials or essences.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>◦There must be no artificial carbonation for draught products.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>◦Sweetener may be added to fully fermented Cider/Perry to make it sweet or medium.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>◦The addition of water is permitted to bring the alcoholic content of the Cider/Perry down to the level required by the producer. Ideally, however the minimum juice content should not be lower than 90% volume.</em></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>◦No micro filtration allowed (this takes all the yeast, leaving a "dead" product).</em></p>
Now, this is a pretty good definition and it certainly conforms with <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/about-cider-perry">CAMRA</a>’s dedication to drinking products containing live yeast. Except, is yeast content at all relevant for a product which is typically fermented and then matured for months (or even years) prior to consumption? Real ale is brewed, placed into a cask prior to being delivered to the pub where it will finish it’s fermentation in the cask resulting in a slight level of natural carbonation (conditioning) once this stage is finished the landlord taps the cask and can begin serving the ale through a hand pump or by simply gravity. Since real cider is seasonal and made but once a year, cider could only be served in this exact way for a small portion of the year, probably somewhere between December and February. The trouble with that is twofold, firstly we ideally want cider to be available year round and secondly the cider at this time would be unlikely to be fully matured.

A cider which is fermented to dryness (that is that all the available sugar in the apple juice has been converted to alcohol) or a cider which has stopped fermenting due to a lack of nutrients for the yeast to consume will generally be stored and sold through the year (and frequently beyond) where there really is no requirement or indeed reliable method of preserving the yeast from the original fermentation in a state of health such as is required in a real ale.

Essentially in my view the <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/about-cider-perry">CAMRA</a> definition falls short because it attempts to make the principles of real ale fit on to cider which is after all a totally different product with much more in common with wine than beer. Although I’d have to admit that low quality industrially produced cider actually has a lot in common with low quality industrially produced beer (So maybe real ale and real cider have ended up together in <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk/about-cider-perry">CAMRA</a>, due more to sharing a common enemy than any meaningful shared process...)

To get a better idea of how the term “Craft Cider” was interpreted I carried out some admittedly limited research on social media. I asked the question “What do you think the term Craft means when applied to a cider?” The first thing that became fairly clear was that there was a big difference in response from cider makers as opposed to cider drinkers. Makers generally dismissed the term as a meaningless marketing term at best, at worst a buzz word for low quality cider with various flavour additives (See <a href="http://caledoniancider.com/rants/how-low-can-you-go-juice-limbo-with-mainstream-uk-ciders/">HERE</a> for a discussion on low quality low juice content ciders). Meanwhile, cider drinkers tended to generally view the term much more positively, suggesting they’d expect higher quality, more providence, no “chemicals” etc. (See <a href="http://caledoniancider.com/rants/uk-cider-ingredients/">HERE</a> for a rant about ciders so called “ingredients”). So whether makers like it or not, the term Craft Cider certainly means something to the people who drink our cider.

To my mind that makes it the responsibility of cider makers to meet that expectation and even to exceed it, to lead the way to new flavours and tastes for cider drinkers. However, by new flavours I don’t mean flavours added by the addition of fruit juice. The current trend (actually building since about 2008 with roots stretching back well into the 70’s if we look at cider and blackcurrant for example) for ciders with various combinations of fruit juice added to them has been described in the media as both “innovation within the cider category” and also “consumer led”. How a consumer can drive innovation is beyond me, consumer led must surely simply drive the copying of existing products rather than actual innovation. And where there’s copying there’s sure to be price cutting and that gets us squarely on a track back to where the cider industry was in the 90’s, the big brands on a race to the bottom. How long until we start seeing strawberry and lime flavoured cider in plastic 3ltr bottles (this would also likely be classed as innovative)

I could easy be wrong on that though and honestly the whole “fruit cider” thing is basically a separate rant for another day.

It is my opinion that Craft Cider should be defined as that which is made from at least 85% apple juice (not from concentrate) and that all other ingredients used (if any) should be listed on the label. And that’s it, just two simple rules. Now, if a cider conforms to this criteria it doesn’t mean the cider is necessarily any good, it could be awful, it just means simply that it was made from a minimum of 85% apple juice (not from concentrate) and that the ingredients are printed on the label.&nbsp; Quality and transparency are the perceived hallmarks of craft beer, why not for craft cider too?]]>


<h2>How We Make Cider: Part One, The Harvest</h2>

<h2>How We Make Cider: The Harvest</h2>


<a href="img/carapples.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-867 alignleft" src="img/carapples.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>Ask any cider maker what their favourite season is and there’s a good chance they’ll answer with autumn. It’s certainly my favourite season by a country mile. Don’t get me wrong, I enjoy summer (especially when it’s as warm and sunny as 2018’s was), spring and of course winter isn’t without its charms but autumn is a very special time for cider makers, for with the autumn comes the apple harvest.

Cider makers tend (in most cases) to be more rurally based than their brewing counterparts with many being based in or around the orchards that supply their apples. Cider is a seasonal drink, it gets made just once a year during the apple harvest. As a result of this seasonality cider makers tend to pay great attention to the changing of the seasons, each  brings its own set of jobs both out in the orchard and in the cidery (pruning, bottling, grass cutting etc.)

But autumn is when cider makers spend the most time out in the orchards surrounded by the (hopefully) fruit laden trees, endlessly attempting to estimate the crop, judge the ripeness of the apples, stress about timings and  crawl about on all fours picking up the harvest.

There’s a crucial difference between the harvesting of apples grown for eating and those destined for a higher purpose, namely cider. Apples bound for the market shelves are carefully picked from the tree (often a week or two before they’re fully ripe, especially if they’re to be exported, in an attempt to extend that all important use by date).  They’re placed gently into bins and shipped away for further scrutiny in a processing plant before going into cold storage. Meanwhile, the apples for our cider are generally allowed to fall to the orchard floor before being picked up and taken to the cidery. There’s a few reasons for this difference in approach to the harvest but basically a bruise here and maybe a bird peck there just don’t matter as much to the cider maker as they might to your casual apple muncher. Beyond the aesthetics though the cider makers interests lay beneath the surface of the apple, under the skin lies the flesh which contains all the sugars and flavours that are required to make a great cider. Ripeness is absolutely critical, we can’t stress that enough. Picking apples up off the floor can be hard on the back (not to mention the long suffering knees) but it ensures we’re definitely getting the apples at their ripest, they don’t fall off the trees if they’re not ready (strong winds aside) This hands and knees stage is also the first and arguably most important step in the cider making process, it’s here on the orchard floor that we decide which fruit goes in the mix and which doesn’t.

Often our apples are sweated/tumped (left in a pile) for a week or so prior to milling to allow more time to attain optimum <a href="img/applebag.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-866 alignright" src="img/applebag.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a>sugar and flavour levels and also to standardise the ripeness of the fruit (there’s always differences from one part of the orchard to the next or even between lower and higher branches on a single tree).

We test the apples in their tump pretty much on a daily basis. We’re looking for any signs of rot (Trying to spot that one bad apple before it starts spreading its influence!), we’re also having a good sniff making sure there’s no sharp acetic notes or anything else untoward wafting about in among the lovely and unique aromas of a load of apples ripening. In addition to sight and smell we also use a third sense, touch, picking a few apples up and giving them a squeeze, when they’re totally ready to go to the mill you should be able to push through the skin with a bit of pressure from your thumb.

Our apple season can be roughly divided in to two halves, early and late. The early apple varieties such as Discovery, Major, Morgan Sweet and Irish Peach start coming in early to mid-September. These varieties rarely keep as well as the later ones so we don’t tend to tump them, instead they just go straight into the mill once we’ve enough to start it up. The later varieties such as Dabinett, James Grieve, Yarlington Mill and Hereford Redstreak tend to start coming in late-October to mid-November. Generally we start pressing the late season fruit around the beginning of December (this year we started a whole month early due to the weirdly mild weather).

This winter we are hoping to do a special late harvest of two varieties, Black Dabinett and Northern Greening, these apples never seem keen to fall off the trees up here in the Highlands giving us the opportunity to wait until they are frozen on the branches. A day or two around minus 10<sup>o</sup>C should do the trick so we will probably be out picking them in January. We will press them while frozen extracting just the super concentrated sweet juice which we will then ferment into a small amount of ice cider.

Cheers,

Ryan.]]>

<p style="font-weight: 400;">Pressing an apple to release the juice held within may seem pretty straight forward, and to an extent it is, but as with everything else in cider making it’s the finer details that can make all the difference.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><a href="img/ryanhandapple.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2554 alignleft" src="img/ryanhandapple.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="199" /></a>The first thing to consider is when to press? The apples should ideally be perfectly ripe, we judge this using a couple of simple techniques. The first thing we tend to check is the firmness of the fruit, we’re looking for it to give way under pressure from the thumb, if it’s hard like a potato then it’s not ready, if it gives like a baked potato then that’s a good indicator it’s nearly ready. Another good test is to cut the apple in half so you can see the pips, they start off white in very under ripe apples then turn brown and gradually darken to almost black in a ripe specimen. The colour of the seeds not only gives us a good indication of ripeness but also lets us judge how long it’ll be before they’re ready.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">So let’s assume we’ve got our heap of apples, they’ve been harvested and tumped (see <a href="http://caledoniancider.com/how-we-make-cider/how-we-make-cider-the-harvest/">previous post</a>) and are now<a href="img/applebag.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-866 alignright" src="img/applebag.jpg" alt="" width="234" height="312" /></a> perfectly ripe and ready to press. The next step is to smash ‘em up. For this we use a mill, ours is kind of like a big funnel that feeds on to a set of spinning blades. There are countless mill designs in use around the world and they all do much the same thing, they chop, crush or shred your apples into a mushy pulp. If you’re on a tight budget you can achieve just the same effect using a bucket and a heavy stick, very satisfying! Now, at this point some cider makers will put the pulp straight into their press and start extracting the juice, nothing at all wrong with that but some, us included, do it a slightly different way. We pack the pulp into barrels, seal them up and leave them for a day or two (sometimes up to 5 days if it’s very cold outside). This is called maceration and basically there’s a couple of things happening to the packed in pulp during this step. Firstly the pulp takes on a stronger colour and aroma from the contact time with the skins and secondly extra pectin is drawn into the juice from within the cell walls. Why do we want extra pectin in our juice? You’ll see in the next post on fermentation.</p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">So after somewhere between one and five days we’re ready to load the pulp into our press. We actually have a couple of presses we use depending on how much fruit we have to press at a time. For larger amounts we use the big oak rack and cloth press, for smaller amounts we use a steel hydro press. In both cases the same thing is happening, the pulp is squeezed which forces the juice out, the resulting juice is then separated from the pulp by means of a fine mesh cloth. We collect the juice in buckets and then pour it straight into barrels to start the next and arguably most exciting stage of the process, fermentation.</p>
Cheers,

Ryan.

<h2>How We Make Cider: Part three, Fermentation</h2>

<p class="western">Once you’ve got the juice from the apples then next thing to do is ferment it into cider. Fermentation is quite simply the conversion of sugar into alcohol by yeast.</p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #222222;"><span style="font-family: Arial, serif;">Sugar (with yeast) = Alcohol + Carbon Dioxide</span></span></p>
<p class="western">This step is probably the most widely discussed stage in cider making and as always there are many ways of going about it.</p>
<p class="western">So before we get to talking about yeast there’s a step we do for some of our cider that sits in between pressing and fermentation and it’s called keeving. So if you remember in the post on pressing (<a href="http://caledoniancider.com/how-we-make-cider/how-we-make-cider-the-pressing/">here</a>) I mentioned that during maceration we’re aiming to get the pectin from the cell walls into the juice. The reason for this is that pectin tends in the right conditions to form a gel (kind of like jam) and as the fermentation starts the tiny carbon dioxide bubbles formed (see above) get trapped in that gel which makes it float to the top of the juice. This floating gel does a couple of handy things for us, it helps clear the juice and it also traps nutrients that the yeasts use to grow. Then we pump the clearer juice from under the gel into another barrel ready to ferment into cider. We want to remove a portion of the nutrients so that the yeasts don’t consume all the sugar in the juice, leaving us with a naturally sweeter cider.</p>
<p class="western">Lots of cider makers, similar to brewers or wine makers will add a specific strain of yeast to carry out their fermentation. The idea here is to get consistency from batch to batch, consistency of both flavour and fermentation time (some large scale cider makers complete the whole fermentation in just 7 days, we’re considerably slower than that). Many excellent ciders are made using commercial yeasts but we choose to do It a slightly different way. We don’t add any yeast, instead we rely on the natural yeasts which are already present on the apples in the orchards. We do this for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we believe the depth of flavour and complexity achieved from a “wild” or natural fermentation to be greater. Secondly, commercial yeast strains have specific temperatures that they like to work in and out with these parameters they tend to get stressed and create off flavours. We don’t have any form of temperature control in the cider shed so we ferment entirely at ambient temperature, which for us up in the Highlands tends to be much lower than commercial yeast can handle. It’s not uncommon for our juice to freeze several times during its fermentation with temperatures rarely exceeding 5 or 6 degrees, to attempt to use a commercial yeast strain in these conditions would be folly. Plus, on a slightly more philosophical level, we’re trying to make a purely Highland cider and to truly do that I think you need to not only be using local fruit, but also local yeasts at local temperatures. It would be needlessly difficult, not to mention expensive for us to make a cider like Strongbow or Thatchers Gold for example.<a href="http://caledoniancider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/46745350_2301674370062174_4276199452852617216_n.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-2580 alignright" src="http://caledoniancider.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/46745350_2301674370062174_4276199452852617216_n-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p class="western">Another fermentation choice is what sort of container you’re going to use. There’s lots of options ranging from earthenware amphora or glass to plastic or stainless steel. For us the option that makes most sense is oak in the form of ex whisky casks (we are in the Highlands after all so for us they are both local and plentiful). Fermenting and maturing in oak barrels is about as traditional as it gets when it comes to cider making but it’s not without its drawbacks, the main one being they can be a real pain to clean and also the cider within is constantly changing. On the plus side the barrels themselves can impart some flavour and they’re also a great place for those wild yeasts to hang out from season to season with each cask eventually building up its own “personality”.</p>
<p class="western"><a name="_GoBack"></a>Due to these fermentation choices (in our case; keeving, wild yeasts, low temperatures and ex whisky casks) it takes a long time to turn our juice into cider, about 5 months in fact! But for me I don’t think we could do it any other way and honestly say we were making a cider that truly reflects our local environment, our terroir if you like.</p>

<h2>Fruit Cider: Cost, Compromise & Craft</h2>

<span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">The rise of the fruit cider category over the last 10 years or so has been both dramatic and divisive in the cider community, on the one side you have the purists and traditionalists who believe cider should only contain apples while on the other you have lots of cider newcomers who are enjoying the variety of flavours on offer. Personally I'd describe myself as a fruit cider sceptic, I'm not against the concept but I have concerns about the practices at work, hopefully this post will help explain those concerns.</span></span>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">According to the latest cider report from Westons (<a href="https://www.westons-cider.co.uk/download-cider-report/">available here</a>) 40% of all cider sold in the UK is now fruit cider.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now, another way of looking at that statistic is that 40% of cider sold in the UK is now actually not cider at all. The reason why it isn’t cider is that the only fruits legally permitted to be made into cider are apples* in much the same way that the only meat permitted to be in a beef lasagne is beef (as opposed to horse). </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So if fruit cider isn’t cider then what is it? Well on the surface that’s a fairly easy question to answer, it’s Made-Wine, and made wine is defined for us in <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/excise-notice-163-wine-production/excise-notice-163-wine-production">HMRC Notice 163</a> as follows;</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #0b0c0c;">‘<span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Made-wine’ means “liquor which is of a strength exceeding 1.2% and which is obtained from the alcoholic fermentation of any substance or by mixing a liquor so obtained or derived from a liquor so obtained with any other liquor or substance but does not include wine, beer, black beer, spirits or cider”</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #0b0c0c;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So it’s pretty much a catch all term for everything that you could possibly make that isn’t wine, beer, cider or a spirit. </span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="color: #0b0c0c;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A very good question to ask might be; how come a made wine can be sold and marketed as cider if it isn’t actually cider? Well, the thing is, is it? If you read the labels of most of these products they describe themselves as cider </span></span></span><span style="color: #0b0c0c;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><u>with</u></span></span></span><span style="color: #0b0c0c;"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;"> *insert fruit here* rather than specifically fruit cider.</span></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Kopparberg for example state on their <a href="img/kopp.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-2589 alignleft" src="img/kopp.jpg" alt="" width="289" height="300" /></a>front label Premium Cider with Mixed Fruits. So is it just that we’re calling it fruit cider instead of cider with other fruits added then? Is it just a misnomer? Well, yes and no. If I have a glass of cider and add a dash of blackcurrant then most would agree that what I’ve now got is a glass of cider and blackcurrant. What if I had a glass of blackcurrant and I put in a dash of cider, it could still be described as cider and blackcurrant which would of course still be true. But what if I had a glass of water and added a dash of cider, a dash of blackcurrant and a tablespoon of sugar, would it still be a glass of cider and blackcurrant?</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">In a previous post (<a href="http://caledoniancider.com/rants/how-low-can-you-go-juice-limbo-with-mainstream-uk-ciders/">read it here</a>) I wrote about how shamefully low the actual apple content can be in some UK ciders, and as low as that paltry 35% minimum may seem there is no minimum amount for a made wine (It’s not a cider remember so to specify a legal minimum apple content would make no sense for a made wine). So if I made a drink that failed to legally qualify as cider due to its low apple content, for arguments sake let’s say it’s got just 15% apple content and I put in some blackcurrant and raspberry concentrate, let’s say 1% as you don’t need much to go a long way. I could then market that product as Cider with Blackcurrant &amp; Raspberry, or probably Premium Cider with mixed fruits or something (because hey why not?) even though 84% of what's in the glass is neither cider nor mixed fruits.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">As poorly regulated as cider is in the UK, the regulations around made wine are by necessity of the breadth of its definition even looser. I was once approached by a sales rep from a Swedish company who offered a range of fruit concentrates and flavourings in various combinations, during the pitch he also pointed out that if desired his company can even provide the ethanol for your fruit cider meaning you just have to add water and bubbles before bottling.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So in general my issue with “Fruit Cider” lies with both the fruit (Frequently this is just cheaply sourced concentrate and flavourings) and the cider element (which can be made from any minuscule quantity of apple juice). </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Now, it would be ludicrous for me to just say that all cider &amp; fruit/adjunct combinations are low quality, of course there are legitimate examples out there but they are comparatively rare due to the exploitation and saturation of the category by the lower quality options, and are by necessity more expensive. The duty rates, after all, are heavily stacked in favour of a higher water content product.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">A 100% juice cider at 7.4% alcohol is taxed at 50.7p/litre. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This rate rises to £2.97/litre if I were to add a handful of elderflowers to it, that’s an increase in taxation of nearly 487%. A cider that was £4.50 a bottle in a pub would become something like £7.50. The reason for this duty hike is due to cider having a list of permitted ingredients, anything added which is not on that list causes the cider to become classified as a made wine  (to see what IS on that list have a read of <a href="http://caledoniancider.com/rants/uk-cider-ingredients/">this previous post)</a></span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">However if I add some water at the same time as my elderflowers, almost doubling the volume in fact, that would bring my alcohol content down to 4%** and would then mean my made wine / fruit cider only incurred taxation of 91.7p/litre. This water addition would lower my juice content by 46% meaning the consumer is getting almost half a pint of water in every pint of fruit cider! Now that is assuming we started off with a 100% juice cider at 7.4% alcohol but as shown in the previous post on <a href="http://caledoniancider.com/rants/how-low-can-you-go-juice-limbo-with-mainstream-uk-ciders/">juice content</a> it’s unlikely the bigger producers are starting with anything like that much apple content. There's an interesting loophole however which has been seized on by a couple of cider companies that simply provide the bar with a range of syrups to add to the glass before filling thus paying the lower cider duty rate. </span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Taxing cider on it's alcohol content isn't a great idea from a quality perspective. If a brewer wants to make a 4% beer then they simply put the appropriate quantity of malt into the mash which results in a starting sugar content which will dictate the final alcohol content. Cider, however is NOT beer and it's NOT brewed. Apple juice contains naturally occurring sugars which dictate the final alcohol content in the cider, there are only 2 ways of adjusting that sugar level, to lower it add water or to increase it add sugar. This difference between beer and cider is crucial because it's as if a brewer has made a beer at 8% then just added water to make it 4% rather than making a 4% beer in the first place, the diluted beer would be inferior in every instance, likewise our brewer may have made a 4% beer then added sugar to make it ferment to 8%, again the beer would be inferior to one originally made to achieve 8% as beer isn't simply fermented sugar, it is fermented malt as cider is fermented apple juice not just sugar. The duty system in the UK is at best a confused mess, that's a whole other rant for another day though.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">This might be a controversial statement but I strongly suspect that most "fruit cider" sold at 4% alcohol is only 4% for one reason, cost. There's not much craft about making a product to cost and compromising on the quality. There is after all the option to just not make it rather than compromise and make something  that isn't all it could be.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">It’s clear that there is a demand for ciders with added fruits / adjuncts, unfortunately for the drinkers it’s near impossible under the current set of rules that they will be offered something that is as good as it could possibly be. Two products however that stand out for me are <a href="https://oliversciderandperry.co.uk/">Tom Oliver's At The Hop</a> range and <a href="https://turnerscider.co.uk/">Turners Elderflower</a>, both coming in at 5.5% abv the makers have made the decision to not add more water to hit the 4% mark and have taken the hit on the extra duty this alcohol incurs, that takes a degree of integrity as a cider maker and in my view should be recognised and celebrated.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">So is it possible to make a genuine real "fruit cider" that isn't overly expensive? Yes, go with the producers you trust who have the integrity to put quality before cost and list their ingredients fully.</span></span></p>
<p class="western"><span style="font-family: Calibri, serif;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Good luck seeking them out.</span></span></p>

<h2>A Guide for Real Cider at CAMRA Festivals</h2>

[Here's the current CAMRA Definition of Real Cider and Perry (2019)
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Ingredients</strong>
o The liquid content before fermentation must consist entirely of non-pasteurized apple (cider), or
pear (perry) juice
o No apple or pear juice concentrates to be used.
o Normally, only the sugar naturally available in the fruit should be used to cause fermentation, but
in years when the level of natural sugar in the fruit is low, the addition of extraneous sugar to aid
fermentation is acceptable.</li>
 	<li><strong>Process</strong>
o No pasteurization to take place during the production process.
o No added colourings to be used.
o No added flavourings to be used, except pure fruits, vegetables, honey, hops, herbs and spices,
yet no concentrates, cordials or essences.
o There must be no artificial carbonation for draught products.
o Sweetener may be added to fully fermented Cider/Perry to make it sweet or medium.
o The addition of water is permitted to bring the alcoholic content of the Cider/Perry down to the
level required by the producer. Ideally, however the minimum juice content should not be lower
than 90% volume.
o No micro filtration allowed (this takes all the yeast, leaving a "dead" product).</li>
</ul>
Here's a couple of rules of thumb to guide you to CAMRA compliant real cider
<ul>
 	<li>Unless it's a dry fruit cider then it's pasteurised or sterile filtered</li>
 	<li>If it's dry and less that 6% then it's likely to be below the 90% juice minimum</li>
 	<li>It can be in bottles as well as Bag in Box</li>
 	<li></li>
</ul>


<h2>Big Decisions and New Opportunities for 2020</h2>

Making cider in the highlands comes with its own unique set of challenges and I think for the most part we’ve managed to turn them to our advantage and put out some really interesting ciders over the last few years. However, this season has presented us with the biggest obstacle yet. The overnight temperatures in the big orchards at Tore and Kiltarlity (which grow the bulk of the apples we use for cider making) dropped below zero on the 7<sup>th</sup>, 12<sup>th</sup> and  29<sup>th</sup> of May effectively wiping out this years apple crop. Only a handful of our late blossoming cider varieties and our reliable old Katy have managed to produce any apples.

So when that happens as a cider maker you’re left with just two options, take a year off or source fruit from elsewhere. So after much deliberation and general head scratching we’ve decided to do both. We won’t be producing any of our core range (North Shore, Strange Bru and Local Rocket) this year as the use of our locally grown fruit is so vital to not just the flavour but also the integrity of these purely Highland ciders.

But the good news is that we’ve also decided that we much prefer making cider to not making cider so to that end we’re very excited to say that we'll be collaborating with Ross Mangles, a third generation Somerset orchardist who will be sending up a whole load of unsprayed, classic bittersweet cider apples from his orchard in Haselbury Plucknett for us to press into juice and transform into cider. The plan is to blend these Somerset grown apples with what we have of our own Highland grown varieties this year to create a small range of new ciders for 2020. Our production practices will remain completely unchanged, all wild fermented in whisky casks, a proportion of the juice being keeved and the rest allowed to ferment dry with these casks then being blended to produce ciders naturally ranging from dry to sweet.

We are obviously hoping for more favourable weather next May which will allow us to get back to making our core local range but in the meantime we’re really looking forward to experimenting with the Somerset fruit and we’ve got some great varieties to play with. A fascinating fusion of old and new cider terroir.

At the moment we're tentatively referring to the cider as "North and South" and we’ll hopefully end up with something that reflects its roots in both the orchards of Somerset and the cold whisky casks of the Highlands.

So if you’re a fan of our current ciders hopefully you’ll enjoy next years too and with a wee bit of luck we’ll see North Shore returning again for 2021.

Cheers,

Ryan

<h2>Is This Real?</h2>


<p>Don't worry, this isn't a philosophical article on the fluid and hallucinatory nature of reality. This one is about the CAMRA definition of Real Cider, its flaws and its lack of enforcement.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> So what actually do CAMRA mean by Real Cider? The answer to this, on the face of it is quite simple since (just as with Real Ale)  CAMRA  has a definition, in a nutshell it is a cider “made from the freshly pressed juice of apples, not syrup and not pasteurised or artificially carbonated”. You can and probably should go read the full definition <a href="https://camra.org.uk/campaign_resources/camra-definition-of-real-cider-and-perry/">here</a>. So given how straightforward that seems why then is there such an enormous amount of confusion over what is and what isn’t a Real Cider?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> If you think I’m exaggerating the level of confusion just take a look at the <a href="https://camra.org.uk/about/publications/camras-good-beer-guide/camras-good-beer-guide-app/">CAMRA Good Pub Guide app</a>, there's an option on the front page to search for nearby pubs with Real Cider, a list of local pubs will appear, press on one and then press on the apple logo under the 'Features' heading to get details of the Real Cider on offer. The top five results for my area offer Gwynt Y Ddraig Black Dragon, Westons Old Rosie, Thistly Cross (bottles), Old Mout (!) and finally Thatchers Heritage. Not a single one of these ciders meets the criteria of Real Cider as defined by  <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">CAMRA</a>*. I'm not saying these are necessarily bad ciders of course, just that they aren't Real Cider. Just imagine the outrage among  <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">CAMRA</a>  members if a pub listed for Real Ale was found to just be selling Heineken drawn through a hand pump? Yet there’s very little outrage (if any in fact) from  <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">CAMRA</a>s many cider enthusiasts entering a pub recommended for it's selection of Real Cider and being offered an Old Rosie or a Mango flavour Lilleys. The issue I believe stems from the widely held misconception that a Bag-in-Box cider is a Real Cider, and much like the assumption that Real Ale exclusively comes from a cask it is wholly incorrect.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> The life of a Real Ale / Cider publican would be much easier if this were the case but it just isn’t. Real Ale is increasingly found in bottles, cans and KeyKegs. Real Ale is no longer definable by its storage / dispense method and neither is Real Cider. The added complexity this introduces can’t be overestimated but while all cask ale is Real Ale (as far as I know), all bag in box cider is certainly not Real Cider.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> So how on earth are we supposed to know what is and isn’t real when it comes to cider? Should  <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">CAMRA</a>  provide a list of known Real Ciders? And could such a list even be maintained given how many products come and go throughout the year? Would guidelines or a crib sheet help? Should the guardianship of Real Cider be outsourced to a trade organisation such as <a href="https://www.smallindependentcidermakers.co.uk/">SICA</a> (Small Independent Cidermakers Association) or the <a href="https://cideruk.com/">NACM</a> (National Association of Cidermakers)? Does it matter?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These are all difficult questions which will need to be addressed by the dedicated team of volunteers and enthusiasts at <a href="https://camra.org.uk/">CAMRA</a>  over the coming months. In the meantime the best advice I could give publicans (and indeed beer &amp; cider festival organisers) would be that Bag in Box doesn’t mean Real, you need to look beyond the container and don't stop at pasteurisation.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>One popular cider supplier <a href="https://fetchthedrinks.com/">Fetch The Drinks</a> have a tab on their website which allows you to see only un-pasteurised ciders, if they added a handful more parameters to that option then they would be making it extremely easy for customers to buy Real Cider from them.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve made a short "Real Cider Test" detailing seven simple questions that need to be answered to ensure you’re getting cider that is compliant with the  current CAMRA definition of "Real Cider"</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Good luck hunting down the Real stuff everyone.</p>

<title>Can cider be art?</title>

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">Now, I’m not talking about labels here, although obviously some of them are totally brilliant, my current personal favourite being that of <a href="https://store.wrightsfood.co.uk/products/skyborry-pommage-keeved-cider">Pomage</a> by <a href="http://www.skyborrycider.co.uk/">Skyborry Cider</a> which I’ve never actually tasted but want to on that basis alone. In this post I’m talking about the possibilities of the actual liquid of cider as a work of art...  </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-thumbnail"><img src="img/pommage.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4276"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">Art is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">Using this definition (which I think seems to be a fair one) could we ever say that cider is art? I think there’s a good argument to make for it. All cider is a product of human creativity and imagination to some degree (obviously there’s a scale here) and much like any other art form we can experience cider using all our senses. While it can certainly be pleasant to hear the pop, hiss and splosh or see the effervescent and shimmering golden liquid play with light in unexpected and mesmerising ways, ciders real impact comes from its aroma*. Aroma can do extraordinary things to a person, when you smell something your brain is forced to wander back in time through myriad corridors and rooms searching for an association, a memory of a time when you first experienced it, first learned a name for it, the first whiff of freshly cut grass, bread from an oven or summer rain on hot tarmac and for just a moment we lose ourselves. An oft given example is found in Swanns Way by Marcel Proust where the narrator is catapulted into nostalgic reverie by the taste of a tea soaked cake. Taste and memory are, we can say with absolute certainty, heavily intertwined and therefor so is cider.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">OK, so we’ve more or less established that cider is a (mostly) human creation and that it has the power to evoke an emotional response. So far so art then. But I think there’s one more crucial hurdle for cider to jump before it can gain entry to the Tate** For me a cider-as-art must be both appreciated and made, primarily for the sake of its beauty. This is the tricky bit. It really comes down to the philosophy of the cidermaker and the <em>reason</em> for the cider they make. “Why do artists make their art?” and “Can art be made for money?” are hardly new questions but they are interesting to think about in the context of cider. Cidermakers (like everyone else) need money to live so we can hardly discount any cider that is sell-ing as being a sell-out, there instead exists the exact same uneasy, endlessly debated and somehow mutual relationship between art and finance. So if it’s not the money that determines the authenticity of the artwork then what is it? Does it go back to the reason the cider was made? If it was made to fill a gap in a market or made to fit a certain price band then it doesn’t feel right to call it art does it? For me that would veer towards the mass re-produced pictures that sit on the shelves of our supermarkets (they may be nice to look at but they are basically just wall fillers). To be art, cider must be made purely for the joy of creating it, because it <em>can</em> be done not because it <em>must</em> be done. It’s a bit like artwork that’s used for advertising, there’s a big difference (to me) between if it was commissioned to be made as advertising or if it was created then co-opted into its advertising role if you know what I mean? And that’s how I see it with cider. A cider made to a margin or a style guided by market research may well be good but is it art and could it ever be great?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">Cider made in this way is never going to be big business, it needs support to continue and even flourish, it needs patronage. Specialist retailers, craft focused bars and restaurants are all key outlets but on a more grassroots level so are the cider clubs. Cider clubs like that organised by <a href="https://rosscider.com/ciderclub/">Ross on Wye Cider &amp; Perry</a> in Peterstow are a lot like exhibitions where art lovers get to meet the artists and hear them explain their work. Other cider clubs have sprung up around the country in the last couple of years (<a href="https://centralmanchester.camra.org.uk/?page_id=433">Manchester</a> being particularly noteworthy for its trailblazing enthusiasm and pioneer attitude) offering similar opportunities to experience, taste, learn and above all enjoy these rare and wonderful ciders often in the company of the makers themselves, this grass roots movement is spreading the word to areas of the country where cider has rarely been seen in its finest and purest forms, far flung galleries curating some of the finest examples of cider on the planet with little fanfare and great modesty. A new breed of cider drinker is emerging, the <a href="https://www.ibd.org.uk/learn/the-beer-and-cider-academy/">Beer and Cider Academy</a> in London is now training Pommeliers (actual Cider Somelliers!) who are going forth into the wilderness armed with both knowledge and enthusiasm, a great example of what this means for cider can be seen just north of Durham at <a href="https://www.framferment.co.uk/">Fram Ferment</a>, a bottle shop and tap room run by Susannah Mansfield who having freshly qualified as a Pommellier is now bringing the finest examples of what cider can be to a whole new group of people in a new area in a new way far from the traditional cider heartlands, a cider missionary if you like.  <a href="https://www.framferment.co.uk/">Fram Ferment</a> is hosting a  quarterly cider club featuring both phenomenal ciders and their makers to explain them. Also, very recently <a href="https://craftynectar.com/pages/fine-cider-club">Crafty Nectar</a> have launched a fine cider subscription which will act as a sort of online cider club thus opening the door to a whole world of cider possibilities that would hitherto have been unimaginable for many.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph {"align":"center"} -->
<p class="has-text-align-center">Now, exhibitions (is that the right word for a   cider club) often have price tags so let's get back to money. These ciders will almost invariably cost you more than a bottle of mass produced stuff from the supermarket, sometimes considerably more. These higher prices aren't funding a lavish cidermakers jet set lifestyle (at least, not to my knowledge), they aren't going into shady off shore bank accounts or dodgy hedge funds, in fact that's more likely where your £1.50 a bottle mainstream cider mass produced by a big international brewing conglomerate is going. The higher price is allowing an artist to continue to make their art and that must (for no other reason than the world would be a poorer place without it) be a price worth paying. Obviously most of us can't afford to only drink the finest ciders known to man, there's nothing wrong with your standard go to cider after all. These ciders are a treat, an occasion in themselves, Champagne wouldn't be Champagne if we drank it everyday would it? They're to be savoured and enjoyed, experienced and talked about, we don't go to the gallery to see the latest KFC advert, we go to see something special.</p>

<h2>On Cider and Beer Part 1</h2>


<p>The other day I found myself with a spare afternoon and it occurred to me that I’ve not brewed any beer in a good couple of years.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":4322,"width":192,"height":192,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large is-resized"><img src="img/brew.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4322" width="192" height="192"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So I started by looking out all the numerous pieces of equipment, stowed away in various dusty cupboards and the littlest used corners of sheds. The huge stockpot that serves as my mash tun had been repurposed into a juice collection trough during last year’s pressing season and had since been stacked away along with all the other pressing paraphernalia behind two full pallets of cider! Once I had gathered all the bits and pieces together I dusted off my dog eared and much wort stained copy of Brew by James Morton which has been my go-to source of beer recipes since it first graced my shelf away back in 2016.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As I sat there perusing the various beer styles trying to decide what to make, it struck me that something was missing. Freedom. You see, deep down what I really wanted to do was ignore those tried and trusted recipes with their wee packets of dried yeast and vacuum packed hop pellets, the sacks of pre-crushed malts and the various salts and powders to make my tap water taste like London tap water. What I really wanted to do was brew forty wildly different batches of beer, let them spontaneously ferment outdoors in various wooden casks and other assorted receptacles for a few months and then upon rediscovering them in the spring start blending them by taste into whatever I wanted. This is total madness to a brewer but to a cider maker it seems like the most natural thing in the world…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Brewing you see, is a science. Beer is a recipe, and just like any other recipe if it is followed to the letter then the result will always&nbsp; be exactly the same. Now I’m not saying there’s no room for creativity in beer, recipes after all don’t write themselves and I’m sure that for most brewers the creation of a new beer would represent the most exciting part of their job. I’m not a brewer but my job on the stills at a whisky distillery certainly bears some resemblance to brewing, except of course we only have one recipe and it was written 200 years ago, life on the stills is many things but creative is not one of the words often used to describe it. The craft (if you’ll excuse the term) in brewing to my mind comes from recipe creation, the craft in whisky for the most part I believe, resides in the warehouse.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now, I know not all cider is made the same way and that the guys making Strongbow for example probably aren’t exactly flexing their creative muscle on a daily basis because much like in brewing the “recipe” was created years ago and the job now is to replicate it time after time with total and unwavering consistency. Going back to my art analogy from my <a href="https://caledoniancider.com/rants/can-cider-be-art/">last post</a>, if Henry Bulmer in 1889 was the artist then Bulmers (now owned by brewer, Heineken) in 2020 is a printer churning out millions of reproductions on a daily basis, we can’t afford the original but we can still be impressed by the copy. As an aside I wonder if Henry Bulmer would be impressed if he tasted a glass of Bulmers Original now?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This rumination on creativity got me thinking about some fundamental differences between brewing and cidermaking (that is to say cidermaking the way I do it rather than the way Heineken do it, and brewing the way Heineken do it rather than the way a Norwegian farmer might do it). I think the heart of the issue is Earth's orbit around the Sun and Earth's axial tilt relative to the ecliptic plane or in other words, the seasons. For people to survive the winter we need to ration out summers bounty, preserving food has always been of the utmost importance to those of us who choose to live in one place. To this end grains and hops can be dried and stored indefinitely, apples on the other hand tend to perish within a couple of months of the harvest. So while brewers can brew beer year round, cidermakers can only produce cider once per year. Now basically that means that if you want to drink cider all year round you need to make a large enough amount of it in autumn but if you want to drink beer all year round then you just have to dry and store all your ingredients and brew as and when required. The importance of this natural historical difference can’t be downplayed, while last autumns cider continues to change throughout the year, the beer is consistent because it gets brewed afresh every few weeks to the same recipe that worked last time. This historical stuff might not seem that relevant to our modern producers but its effects can be seen almost the minute you enter a brewery or a cidery. Brewers have a real penchant for stainless steel pipework with fixed pumps whereas cidermakers have a real thing for flexible pipes with mobile pumps. Cidermakers require almost endless flexibility to move stuff around all over the place as dictated by the cider itself whereas the brewing process only ever takes place in a set and highly methodical way. From a cidermakers perspective, brewers seem obsessed with control. The yeast is of lab grade purity, the malts are ordered in to match highly specific parameters, the last vestige of nature’s influence comes from the hops which are analysed to allow the brewer to tweak their recipe accordingly. Brewing often feels like a struggle against nature to bend it to our will. Cidermaking however is much more of mutual thing, working with nature or attempting to guide it to a place that suits both parties. That’s not to say there’s less care required to make cider, I mean we only get one shot at it each year so if we mess it up somehow then it’s going to be a long wait for the re-do.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Just as an aside, an interesting thing I heard said once was that most cidermakers only get 40 or 50 attempts (if they’re lucky) to get it right in their lifetime while brewers can run up hundreds of batches in a single year. For me that seasonality of cidermaking adds a certain poignancy, reflecting on the seasons gone and thinking about the ones yet to come. I always get a great sense of connectivity during the pressing season, not just the obvious connections to the season and the other cidermakers around the country but also to the past and the future. There’s a timelessness to cidermaking, storing goodness to get us through the winter, bottling a small piece of summer to give a wee bit of light in the dark winter.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>But then this is only really talking about one type of brewing and one type of cidermaking. Comparing the process of brewing a Finnish Sahti with making Somersby Cider for example would flip the whole thing on its head.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In the interests of brevity I think the next part of this rambling post will be vaguely about the areas were brewing and cidermaking crossover, the shared ground between natural cider and farmhouse ale, the lunatic fringe…I may even try to speak to a brewer of such things to get their perspective.</p>

<h2>Why should you care about juice content?</h2>

<p>If you spend any amount of time around cider people then sooner or later you’re bound to hear the term “Full Juice”, but what do we mean by it and why do some people seem to think it’s important?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here’s a couple of opening statements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"type":"1"} -->
<ul type="1"><li>A book is made from paper bound together with or without writing in it.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Cider is made from apple juice.</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So the “ingredients” of a book are paper and possibly writing. If I go to the shop and get some paper and bind it together then I’ve made a book. Although with cider if I go to the shop and buy some apple juice I won’t have made cider. This is because apple juice isn’t really an ingredient of cider, it gets transformed by fermentation <em>into</em> cider. So a more accurate way of saying the above would be cider is fermented apple juice (Not made from, not made with…just IS).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p><strong>So if fermented apple juice is cider then that must mean that cider is fermented apple juice, right?</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, despite the sound logic of that question the answer is actually, not always. And this is where the term Full Juice comes in. Full juice is generally used to describe a cider which is made solely by the fermentation of apple juice. As discussed in <a href="https://caledoniancider.com/rants/how-low-can-you-go-juice-limbo-with-mainstream-uk-ciders/">this previous post</a> the UK has legislation which states that cider must be made from a minimum of 35% fermented apple juice (If you’re wondering what the other 65% could be then the answer is mostly water).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cidermakers will often talk about juice content to differentiate their ciders from the 35% juice ones (the 35% juice guys tend not to talk about juice content so much). You'll often see it displayed proudly on labels or referenced in tasting notes, the UK's first craft cider magazine has even called itself <a href="https://fulljuice.co.uk/">Full Juice</a> perhaps as a nod to what separates the craft from the crap.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"align":"right","id":4378,"sizeSlug":"large"} -->
<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="alignright size-large"><img src="img/cans.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4378"/></figure></div>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Cider drinkers though tend to talk about juice content because they’re looking for quality, provenance and value for money. The point about value for money is actually quite an interesting one because to some at first glance it may seem counter intuitive. Obviously apple juice is more expensive than water, so let’s say your national brand of cider costs £2 per 500ml bottle while your full juice cider is on the shelf for £3.50, on the face of it your national brand is offering better value but, given that 65% of that bottle is actually water is it genuinely good value? If we adjust that price to take into account the actual cider (since realistically who wants to pay for water in their cider) then the “cheap” national brand comes out at £5.71 per 500ml of <strong>cider</strong> (as opposed to water and cider) compared to your full juice alternative at £3.50…in short cheap ciders are cheap because they’re watered down. I’m not saying that’s necessarily a bad thing and if you enjoy drinking it then hey what’s the difference? But to think they’re good value is simply not true. To put it another way, if you buy 24 cans of seemingly cheap cider then the equivalent of 15.6 of them are pretty much just water, very expensive water…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So as a cider drinker how are you expected&nbsp;to know the difference between something which is 65% water and something which is, well, cider? One easy way is probably just to get used to the taste, here’s an easy experiment to try at home.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><li>Fill one glass with apple juice (any apple juice will do for this) then fill the other to about 1/3 of the way up</li><li>Top up the 2<sup>nd</sup> glass with water</li><li>&nbsp;Taste them</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>You’ll probably notice that glass two is paler, tastes less sweet and will in general taste thinner or more watery. If you want you could add 4 or 5 teaspoons of sugar to number 2, this should adjust the sweetness to match glass 1 but it will still have less taste be watery and feel thinner. Which of the two glasses would you rather drink? And what if instead of the dilution happening behind closed doors in a factory it happened on the bar right in front of you?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:quote -->
<blockquote class="wp-block-quote"><p>Customer “How much for a pint of cider?”</p><p>Landlord “that’ll be £4”</p><p>Customer “Hmm, seems a bit steep!”</p><p>Landlord “OK, I can give you a third for £2 and top it up with water if you want?”</p><p>Customer “Bargain!”</p></blockquote>
<!-- /wp:quote -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I suspect if given the choice most people would choose not to have their cider diluted with water to dubiously appear as good value. Unless of course they’re not that bothered about the taste and just want something cheap, alcoholic and preferably sweet regardless of what it calls itself, some folk just want a weak vodka and lemonade but don’t know how to make it.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>When I think of foods with a range of quality probably the first one that pops into my mind is the humble sausage. We all know that some sausages are better than others and that the cheaper the sausage in general the lower the meat content. On the supermarket shelf it’s easy to see this, the ingredients are all printed on the packs and you can make an informed choice (if you wish) of which pack you want, weighing up quality and cost in your head and probably coming up with a suitable compromise between the two. Sausages however, are more open to scrutiny than cider, for one thing they list their ingredients and secondly in most cases they are priced accordingly. One of the interesting things about the supermarket cider shelf is how uniform all the pricing is, there’s the own label stuff at the cheap end then there’s everything else. Here are some of the 500ml bottled ciders and their prices as listed by <a href="https://www.tesco.com/groceries/en-GB/shop/drinks/beer-and-cider/cider">Tesco</a> in July 2020.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list -->
<ul><li>Thatchers Katy £2</li><li>Kopparberg Strawberry &amp; Lime £2.20</li><li>Healey’s Rattler £2</li><li>Thatchers Vintage £2</li><li>Henry Westons Vintage £2</li><li>Rekorderlig Strawberry &amp; Lime £2.20</li><li>Aspall Premier Cru £2</li><li>Brothers Toffee Apple £2</li><li>Old Mout Kiwi &amp; Lime £2.20</li><li>Angry Orchard £2</li><li>Angioletti Cider £2</li><li>Magners £2</li><li>Bulmers Original £2</li><li>Bulmers Red Berries £2</li><li>Crumpton Oaks* £0.85</li></ul>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I could go on longer but what do you notice about this list apart from the fact that Lime seems to cost 20p? There’s no middle ground is there? And that seems weird to me, it’s as if there’s no middle shelf, there’s just one massive extended top shelf and then a bottom shelf. Either this supermarket only deals in genuinely premium cider or some of these guys are telling fibs. Next time you’re in the supermarket have a browse of the prices in the cider section then compare them to the range of prices for beer or wine. In the beer section I’ve got Bavaria Premium at £2/ltr, Ghost Ship at £3.4/ltr and Punk IPA at £4.55/ltr. Beer has a middle shelf, cider doesn’t.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As hinted at earlier on, advertising the fact that your product contains only 35% of what it pertains to be on the label is not a good look and because of this it can be difficult to tell what you’re buying from the label alone. Obviously if a bottle of cider proudly proclaims itself to be full juice or 100% juice or some other similar thing then it’s a safe bet that it genuinely will be due to trading standards and all that. There’s also the <a href="https://www.smallindependentcidermakers.co.uk/">Small Independent Cidermakers Association (SICA)</a> which has a quality mark that can be displayed on ciders verified to be made from at least 90% juice, it’s a small group but as far as I know they are the only one with a verified quality mark. You’re unlikely to find any of these ciders at the supermarket just now but definitely worth keeping a look out at your local farm shop, independent off license or specialist online retailer.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>These posts always end up being longer that I originally intended so as a way of finishing this post off I’d like to point out that of all the ciders in that list only Bulmers** include an ingredients list on their label, you'd be forgiven for wondering why that might be.</p>

<p>***Apple juice from concentrate is itself mostly water and the ingredients have been arranged in this way specifically to avoid having water at the top of the list, I think we could all guess where on the juice content scale this one would sit.</p>

<h2>Starting Up A Cidery</h2>


<p>There is an abundance of information available to the budding cidermaker these days. There are several courses, a good range of informative books and of course countless online articles on the subject of making cider. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So let's assume you've done your research, made a bunch of cider and it's come out tasting pretty good, what next?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, at some point you may wish to turn your cider hobby into something bigger, you might want to be the next Henry Weston (good luck to you) or maybe like me you just found yourself one year with more cider than you and your friends could sensibly get through and you thought of selling off the excess to your local pub. This is my attempt at explaining what you’d need to do in order to do that. There's a 10 step checklist at the end if you're in a hurry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Firstly you might want to register your company with Companies House, this is pretty easy to do, only costs a few pounds and will give you a good opportunity to start referring to yourself as the MD of Such and Such Cider. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation/register-your-company">Here</a> is a link to the government site which has a simple step by step guide on registering your new business</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So once you’ve got your business registered the next thing you’ll need to do is register with HMRC as a cidermaker, again this is pretty easy so long as you’re going to sell less than 7000 litres in a year (anything over this amount and you’ll be due to start paying duty on your cider and this brings with it a few extra complications which I’ll not be going into here). Once you get confirmation back from HMRC then you’ll be MD of an official cidery, which is awesome but there’s still a couple more things to attend to. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-application-to-register-as-a-cider-or-perry-maker-cp30">Here</a> is a link to the cidermaker registration form, HMRC are very helpful with this sort of thing so if you get stuck just give them a phone (it’s in their interests to get you going after all). The other thing you might want to sort out with HMRC is a letter of exemption from the AWRS (Alcohol Wholesale Retailers Scheme), this is used to stop drinks made by unlicensed producers from getting into the marketplace, but as a small cidermaker you’ll be exempt from registration although somewhat counter intuitively you’ll need to register so HMRC have a record that you don’t need to register…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Next you need to let your local council know that you are starting a food business. Now this can frequently be the trickiest bit for a lot of future ciderists. This is the bit where your premises will be visited by an environmental health officer (EHO). The EHO will usually try to help you get where you need to be to start running as safely as possible. There are always tales of EHOs making unrealistic demands but on the whole they will be supportive. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/food-business-registration">Here</a> is a link to registering your food premise. </p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Once you’ve registered with the council you’ll be visited by the EHO who will have a look at where you’re going to be making cider, storing equipment, washing your hands etc. Before they come, spend a bit of time writing out what you do, they don’t care about details such as yeast variety or anything like that, they’re primarily interested in safety so they’ll be wanting to see you’ve taken all the risks into consideration and put a plan in place to minimise them. This is where your HACCP (Hazards Analysis and Critical Control Points) plan comes in. The good news is that cider is considered a low risk food (unlike milk or chicken for example) so your HACCP plan can be nice and simple here’s a straightforward example.</p>

<p>If you use sulphite then you should probably think about adding the legal limit of 200mg/l on as one of your CCP’s as it's a recognised allergen. Also, If you don’t already have one it’s very likely that you will be asked to complete a basic food safety course, there’s lots of these online and they’re relatively quick, simple and inexpensive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So assuming your EHO visit went well then that’s you very nearly there. The last couple of things to think about will be labels (<a href="https://labellingtraining.food.gov.uk/module10/overview_2.html">here’s</a> a link to the current government guidelines on label requirements) and trading standards. Trading standards again seem to have a reputation for bad news but actually they are generally very helpful and if you’re willing to try to work with them they’ll keep you right. It would be a good idea to buy a set of scales that will check that the volume you state on the label matches the contents and if you’ve not got the equipment to test alcohol levels then make sure your records are nice and tidy and you can demonstrate that you’ve calculated the ABV with a reasonable level of accuracy*.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>*Here's a simple formula that i use to predict ABV; (Starting SG - Final SG) x 127.5 = % abv. So as an example (1.060-1.004) x 127.5 = 7.1%abv. It's fairly easy to put that into a simple spreadsheet which will probably be fine for the first year or two.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So as a recap here’s a list of the 10 things required to sell cider to  retailers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:list {"ordered":true,"type":"1"} -->
<ol type="1"><li>Register the company <a href="https://www.gov.uk/limited-company-formation/register-your-company">Here</a></li><li>Register as a cidermaker with HMRC <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/alcohol-duties-application-to-register-as-a-cider-or-perry-maker-cp30">Here</a>, (you may also want to ask for a letter proving exemption from AWRS, it’s not essential but you’ll likely be asked for it by retailers)</li><li>Register as a food premises with your local council <a href="https://www.gov.uk/food-business-registration">Here</a></li><li>Write an outline of your process (pick fruit, store fruit here then press fruit here etc.)</li><li>Write a HACCP plan (or amend one to suit your process)</li><li>Complete a food safety course (takes about 10 mins to complete online)</li><li>Meet your EHO (listen to what they say and let them help you)</li><li>Make sure your labels are legal <a href="https://labellingtraining.food.gov.uk/module10/overview_2.html">here</a></li><li>Ensure your records are fit for purpose and can be used to trace batches ideally from bottle to apple source</li><li>Ensure that you’re selling what you say you’re selling by investing in some scales to weigh a representative proportion of your products.</li></ol>
<!-- /wp:list -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So these steps should get you to the point where you can legally sell cider to your local pub, if you want to start selling to people direct then that’s a much, much more complicated thing and not one that I’ve got nearly enough experience in to be able to guide through you it in any respectable way.</p>

<p>Good luck future cidermakers!</p>

<h2>Cider and Time Travel</h2>


<p>In <a href="https://caledoniancider.com/rants/why-should-you-care-about-juice-content/">this last post</a> we talked about cider being the transformation of apple juice as opposed to it being just made from apple juice. A thing that is made must be made at a specific time while a transformation is a gradual, slow thing that takes place over time or indeed through time. Cider is a wee parcel of history, a thing from the past that becomes the present with each sip and vice versa, a link between two distant points in time. This one started off as a normal article then morphed into a poem, sorry.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:group -->
<div class="wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><!-- wp:verse -->
<pre class="wp-block-verse">in sun and soil and rain the apple tree stands
a bridge that spans the space twixt here and the sun
feet anchored in soil with arms that run
in the wind, asleep with the winter will waken with spring
 
festoon the branches with blossom adored
Unique in the making a new life is formed
it sets out stall for the smallest of things
And cell by cell the summer adds rings

the thing that was earth now turns to fruit
by soil by sun by branch by root,
the light pours down and fills the cracks, the soil becoming sweet.
it shapes itself into a ball, and all
the colours of autumns sprawl are borne upon its cheek
 
The Apples now ripe come down to the ground
Suspended no longer they fall without sound
No more to be fixed tween us and the stars
a transformation, what’s lost now is found
 
now comes the maker as autumn arrives
with seasons and rhythms as old as the hills
from a time long before all the self-service tills
in short the fruits picked up inspected and stored
milled up and pressed up and largely ignored.
 
the sugars so recently won from the ground
the yeast break apart and strew them around
what the sun has made the earth will undo
and make it and break it and make it anew
the vapour escapes and leaves what remains
the gathering liquid with oak as its chains
 
winters go past while memories fade
until one day freed as a glass raised
the cider sipped the change complete
resolution to warmth and joy and heat
 
In every glass, the present and past the space between here and the sun
the moments are shared as time draws in and for a second, we're all just one.

time travel.</pre>



<h2>Taking Stock 2020 - Part 1</h2>


<p>It’s that time of year again when my cidery thoughts invariably turn in two opposing but essentially linked directions, forwards and backwards. Let’s deal with the backwards part first.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>So in the backwards direction I think we can all agree that&nbsp;2020 has been a shitshow.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>In cider terms it was always going to be a different kind of year for Caledonian Cider given our decision to shelve our entire core range of ciders for a year (<a href="https://caledoniancider.com/how-we-make-cider/big-decisions-and-new-opportunities-for-2020/">more details in this post from September&nbsp;2019</a><a href="tel:+442019">).</a>&nbsp;So the plan for&nbsp;2020 was to make a new cider, a&nbsp;50/50 blend of our local apples with apples from Somerset which we called North and South. I wanted North and South to be a gateway cider, an accessible way in to the wonderful world of full juice wild fermented cider. Half of the blend was keeved, the other half was fully dry which gave a crowd pleasing level of sweetness, packed in a 33cl bottle I wanted it to sit casually alongside the more industrialised options and catch people by surprise (by actually tasting of apples and barrels and autumn). The cider itself came out well, albeit a tad fizzier than intended. I sent it away to get bottled at a brewery in Stirling two days before Scotland went in to lockdown, which effectively meant that it had to sit in a tank at the brewery for a week or so longer that it was meant to. During this time it carried on fermenting and as the tank was pressurised it actually ended up carbonating itself (incidentally this is known as the Charmat method and is traditionally used to produce Prosecco). The cider itself came out rather well but it never really got the opportunity to surprise people in the way I wanted it to since all the pubs went and closed, instead it went predominantly to bottle shops who generally only cater to the more discerning end of the market anyway. So I’m aiming to do another batch of it for&nbsp;2021, hopefully this time it will get into the hands of the Magners drinkers and set them on a fantastic full juice journey of discovery.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><a href="img/wild.jpg"><img src="img/wild.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-4455"/></a></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The other thing we did for&nbsp;2020 was increase the amount of limited edition 75cl’s, there were a couple of reasons for this. Firstly to get cider bottled at the brewery I need to put together a minimum of&nbsp;1000 litres. The blends often don’t work out that way so I decided to bottle the smaller blends / experimental single casks myself in the cidery and the quickest way for me to do that is in 75cl bottles.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The first of these was Craobh Làn which is quite possibly the best cider I’ve ever made. My only regret with it was the number of bottles that got broken in various depots and courier vans across the country as I tried to do online sales early in the lockdown. I abandoned the online shop after 4 weeks with just over 35% of all the orders being lost or broken. So that was definitely a lesson learned, quite an expensive one. The next release was meant to be Heavy Sun, which was a cask of the keeved cider that remained after the North and South blend. That was a particularly annoying batch because it sat there in the cask perfectly stable until June when I bottled it, a fortnight later it became apparent that it had restarted its fermentation and was on track to over carbonate itself, which would’ve resulted in gushes of white foam going everywhere once opened. Thankfully I had decided to keep it stashed away in the cidery until I was certain it was stable before selling, so I decanted the bottles back into the cask and let the fermentation finish off completely. I was more wary with the second cask I’d earmarked for Heavy Sun so I left it to sit in its barrel for even longer to make double sure that it wasn’t going to re-start in the bottle. I left this one until September and with no signs of it re-fermenting I went ahead and bottled it. That extra time spent through the summer led to pretty significant levels of malolactic fermentation lending to it a kind of savoury buttery flavour which I quite like but it possibly won’t be to everyone’s taste. The third 75cl release of&nbsp;2020 was Islay Cask which is actually the only thing I released in&nbsp;2020&nbsp;that I had also done in 2019. I’m still figuring out how best to work with the smoky Islay casks, the&nbsp;2019 vintage was much more acid driven attempting to play the smokiness off the lemony acidity as opposed to the&nbsp;2018 which was more tannin driven and fizzier from the bottle conditioning, jury’s still out on which worked best. The&nbsp;2020 iteration will be back to the tannins in the form of Major apples with extra juiciness from an extended maceration.</p>

<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another positive thing I can take from&nbsp;2020 has been working with my cider distributors Grant <a href="https://www.restalkcider.com/">(Re:Stalk)</a> and Adam (<a href="http://www.hardpressedcider.co.uk/">Hard Pressed Cider</a>) both of whom came to the rescue after the online sales debacle offering to take my cider palletised and get it around the country for me. Without them I think I would have had to drink about&nbsp;4000 litres of cider myself which would have had a considerable impact on me both physically and financially, although I probably wouldn’t remember&nbsp;2020 so every cloud I suppose. In fact without their work I doubt many of the people reading this blog would have ever got to try my cider at all so huge thanks to them!</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’d also like to thank Adam Wells and James Finch for their support, excellent <a href="https://malt-review.com/category/spirits/cider/">writing</a> and fun <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCxf6XNHhjZBp32GcGw1Qivw">videos</a>, making the cider world seem bigger and yet closer all at the same time, the bubble is definitely growing. Also I feel like&nbsp;2020 would’ve been even worse if it weren’t for all the team at <a href="http://www.neutralciderhotel.com">The Neutral Cider Hotel</a> spreading their cidery joy and goodness far and wide (Also, buy <a href="https://www.whsmith.co.uk/products/ciderology-from-history-and-heritage-to-the-craft-cider-revolution/gabe-cook/hardback/9781846015656.html?utm_campaign=eq_whs&amp;utm_medium=affiliates&amp;utm_source=awin&amp;awc=3017_1607977396_a694724977975fc9ab96d91cea88cc82">Ciderology</a> by Gabe Cook…)</p>

<p>So that was&nbsp;2020, some good lessons learned and some great new friends made. Now let’s all really try to make&nbsp;2021 something to remember!</p>

<h2>Taking Stock 2020 - Part 2</h2>


    
<p>It's entirely possible that I'm being overly optimistic here, but I feel quite confident that&nbsp;2021 will be good year, assuming we don’t all just sink into the sea after Brexit. Cider wise I’ve some really cool stuff in the pipeline. So, as I mentioned in the last post I’m planning to do a repeat bottling of North and South, made exactly the same way as the&nbsp;2019 (but with a few less bubbles hopefully). I’d love to see that cider sneak its way into some more mainstream outlets, the craft cider Trojan horse (I think I may secretly refer to this plan as Operation Trojan Horse). So aside from that what else have I got planned?</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Well, since we had a good crop up here in the Highlands this year (approximately 5 times better than&nbsp;2019)&nbsp;I’ll be able to relaunch Strange Bru (I know it’s a silly name but it was the first cider we made in the Highlands and it seems a shame to change it after all this time). Last year, due to the poor local apple crop and the size of the blend I sent off for the North and South bottling, I actually had very little dry cider left so it will be awesome to get back to doing that. I’m unsure yet whether it will be released as 33cl or 75cl, it will really depend on the size of the final blend (that said a 75cl Scrumpy could be fun).</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve recently worked out how to photograph my drawings which means for the first time that I can use my hand drawn label artwork (previously I’ve had to attempt to re-do my original sketches using a mouse on my old laptop which hasn’t been great so I’m really looking forward to the&nbsp;2021&nbsp;labels coming out).</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ve put aside a cask each of Katy and James Grieve (with about 10% Bramley) which I’m pretty excited about, the James Grieve is razor sharp and bright as a button with a big banana nose (I’m talking massive foam banana sweeties here!), that will be getting bottled as a new single cask release called “High and Dry”. Also as a single cask bottling will be “This is Ceitidh” made appropriately enough from local Katy apples. I’ve not made a Katy since my days at Thatchers so it’s been quite interesting comparing the profile of this one to what we were making then. It’s light, sherbetty and very floral with a great minerality and only the tiniest dash of barrel influence. I have a feeling our Ceitidh will compare very favourably and I’m excited to try them side by side.</p>

<p>I’ve a couple of casks made for local estates (castles!) From their own orchard crop which have turned out beautifully and also satisfyingly different. I love working with an orchard blend, especially very old orchards such as these, you never know what you’re going to get but you know that it will be what the person who planted it all those years ago wanted it to be. I’ll move on before I start talking about time travel again but I'll hopefully manage to hold on to a case or two of each to put out for general release.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I mentioned the&nbsp;2020&nbsp;vintage Islay Cask in the last post, just now it’s got a few months to go before it’ll be ready but the fruit was some of the best I’ve worked with. An early bittersweet called Major grown on the Black Isle and picked at their absolute prime, macerated for 3 days before pressing straight into a cask from a secret distillery on Islay…I’m aiming for body and texture and a big juicy smoky aroma. Time will tell of course if it comes out like that...</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Another one returning from&nbsp;2020 is Craobh Lan, at the moment it is still macerating in two barrels (doubling last years volume). It’s important that I sniff and taste these at least once every day, they’ve started to ferment now which is the first hurdle, next I just need to judge when to take the juice off the skins. Last year this was in early January but with it being a fair bit warmer this winter it may come sooner. After that stage they will be transferred into new barrels with apple wood cut from the orchard, this stage will last roughly a month before finishing off in yet to be chosen ex whisky casks. It’s a fairly complicated cider to make that relies entirely on the judgement of my nose. Last year it was pure Dabinett, this year it is a blend of Dabinett and Hereford Redstreak so it will be interesting to see what that extra bit of acidity does in such an extravagantly fruit forward cider.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Speaking of whisky casks, I’ve got some new ones in this year from the infamous <a href="https://www.thompsonbrosdistillers.com/">Thompson Brothers</a> of Dornoch, an independent whisky bottler (and distiller) of some note. As ever I can’t name the distilleries but there’s one from a village called Brora, one from Tain and a couple from the Black Isle (one of which is an ex-sherry cask). These have all been filled with an identical batch of Yarlington Mill which had just started to ferment before splitting it into these Hogsheads. There’s so much to barrels that rarely gets spoken about in cider that it would warrant a blog post all of its own. Do specific distilleries / whisky regions pair better with certain styles of cider? Definitely a rabbit hole to explore another day…</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>I’ll be doing a lovely wee batch of cider made purely from garden apples grown locally and swapped for cider during this year’s socially distanced harvest called “This Land is Your Land”. For me there’s something inherently subversive, possibly even anarchic about swapping produce. It harkens right back to the Digger movement</p>

<p>A kind of community agriculture, no one garden has enough to really be useful but if we join together and pool resources we can achieve far greater things<a href="tel:+442020">.</a> 2020 seemed like a very political year (even in the cider world) so this one has taken influence from that and it’s my interpretation of what cider is all about for me. People in all their wonderful and interesting variations working together to make something great for everyone to enjoy. The profits from the first 100 bottles will go directly to <a href="https://moofood.org/">Moo Food</a> which is a community food charity located in the Highlands of Scotland, with the aim to build community resilience by bringing people together to grow food, knowledge and confidence.</p>
