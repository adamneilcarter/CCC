                    Taking Stock 2020 – Part 2

                <p>It’s entirely possible that I’m being overly optimistic here, but I feel quite confident that 2021 will be good year, assuming we don’t all just sink into the sea after Brexit. Cider wise I’ve some really cool stuff in the pipeline. So, as I mentioned in the last post I’m planning to do a repeat bottling of North and South, made exactly the same way as the 2019 (but with a few less bubbles hopefully). I’d love to see that cider sneak its way into some more mainstream outlets, the craft cider Trojan horse (I think I may secretly refer to this plan as Operation Trojan Horse). So aside from that what else have I got planned? </p> 

                <p>Well, since we had a good crop up here in the Highlands this year (approximately 5 times better than 2019) I’ll be able to relaunch Strange Bru (I know it’s a silly name but it was the first cider we made in the Highlands and it seems a shame to change it after all this time). Last year, due to the poor local apple crop and the size of the blend I sent off for the North and South bottling, I actually had very little dry cider left so it will be awesome to get back to doing that. I’m unsure yet whether it will be released as 33cl or 75cl, it will really depend on the size of the final blend (that said a 75cl Scrumpy could be fun).</p>
                <img src="img/strangebrubottle.jpg" alt="cider" class="postimg">

                <p>I’ve recently worked out how to photograph my drawings which means for the first time that I can use my hand drawn label artwork (previously I’ve had to attempt to re-do my original sketches using a mouse on my old laptop which hasn’t been great so I’m really looking forward to the 2021 labels coming out).</p>
        
                <p>I’ve put aside a cask each of Katy and James Grieve (with about 10% Bramley) which I’m pretty excited about, the James Grieve is razor sharp and bright as a button with a big banana nose (I’m talking massive foam banana sweeties here!), that will be getting bottled as a new single cask release called “High and Dry”. Also as a single cask bottling will be “This is Ceitidh” made appropriately enough from local Katy apples. I’ve not made a Katy since my days at Thatchers so it’s been quite interesting comparing the profile of this one to what we were making then. It’s light, sherbetty and very floral with a great minerality and only the tiniest dash of barrel influence. I have a feeling our Ceitidh will compare very favourably and I’m excited to try them side by side.</p>

                <img src="img/highdrybottle.jpg" alt="cider" class="postimgt">
                <p>I’ve a couple of casks made for local estates (castles!) From their own orchard crop which have turned out beautifully and also satisfyingly different. I love working with an orchard blend, especially very old orchards such as these, you never know what you’re going to get but you know that it will be what the person who planted it all those years ago wanted it to be. I’ll move on before I start talking about time travel again but I’ll hopefully manage to hold on to a case or two of each to put out for general release.</p>
        
                <p>I mentioned the 2020 vintage Islay Cask in the last post, just now it’s got a few months to go before it’ll be ready but the fruit was some of the best I’ve worked with. An early bittersweet called Major grown on the Black Isle and picked at their absolute prime, macerated for 3 days before pressing straight into a cask from a secret distillery on Islay…I’m aiming for body and texture and a big juicy smoky aroma. Time will tell of course if it comes out like that…</p>

                <img src="img/craobhbottle.jpg" alt="cider" class="postimgt">
                <p>Another one returning from 2020 is Craobh Lan, at the moment it is still macerating in two barrels (doubling last years volume). It’s important that I sniff and taste these at least once every day, they’ve started to ferment now which is the first hurdle, next I just need to judge when to take the juice off the skins. Last year this was in early January but with it being a fair bit warmer this winter it may come sooner. After that stage they will be transferred into new barrels with apple wood cut from the orchard, this stage will last roughly a month before finishing off in yet to be chosen ex whisky casks. It’s a fairly complicated cider to make that relies entirely on the judgement of my nose. Last year it was pure Dabinett, this year it is a blend of Dabinett and Hereford Redstreak so it will be interesting to see what that extra bit of acidity does in such an extravagantly fruit forward cider.</p>
                <p>Speaking of whisky casks, I’ve got some new ones in this year from the infamous Thompson Brothers of Dornoch, an independent whisky bottler (and distiller) of some note. As ever I can’t name the distilleries but there’s one from a village called Brora, one from Tain and a couple from the Black Isle (one of which is an ex-sherry cask). These have all been filled with an identical batch of Yarlington Mill which had just started to ferment before splitting it into these Hogsheads. There’s so much to barrels that rarely gets spoken about in cider that it would warrant a blog post all of its own. Do specific distilleries / whisky regions pair better with certain styles of cider? Definitely a rabbit hole to explore another day…</p>
                <p>I’ll be doing a lovely wee batch of cider made purely from garden apples grown locally and swapped for cider during this year’s socially distanced harvest called “This Land is Your Land”. For me there’s something inherently subversive, possibly even anarchic about swapping produce. It harkens right back to the Digger movement</p>

                <p>A kind of community agriculture, no one garden has enough to really be useful but if we join together and pool resources we can achieve far greater things. 2020 seemed like a very political year (even in the cider world) so this one has taken influence from that and it’s my interpretation of what cider is all about for me. People in all their wonderful and interesting variations working together to make something great for everyone to enjoy. The profits from the first 100 bottles will go directly to Moo Food which is a community food charity located in the Highlands of Scotland, with the aim to build community resilience by bringing people together to grow food, knowledge and confidence.</p>

                <p>There’s loads of other plans, half plans and even quarter plans but I think that’s probably enough to be getting on with just now. Oh, I may even have a wee non-pomme-centric special waiting in the wings too…</p>
                <p>To say that I’m looking forward to 2021 in cider would be a significant understatement.</p>

                    Taking Stock 2020 – Part 2

                <img src="img/northsouthbottle.jpg" alt="cider" class="posthead">
                <p>It’s that time of year again when my cidery thoughts invariably turn in two opposing but essentially linked directions, forwards and backwards. Let’s deal with the backwards part first.</p>
                <p>So in the backwards direction I think we can all agree that 2020 has been a shitshow.</p>
                <p>In cider terms it was always going to be a different kind of year for Caledonian Cider given our decision to shelve our entire core range of ciders for a year (more details in this post from September 2019). So the plan for 2020 was to make a new cider, a 50/50 blend of our local apples with apples from Somerset which we called North and South. I wanted North and South to be a gateway cider, an accessible way in to the wonderful world of full juice wild fermented cider. Half of the blend was keeved, the other half was fully dry which gave a crowd pleasing level of sweetness, packed in a 33cl bottle I wanted it to sit casually alongside the more industrialised options and catch people by surprise (by actually tasting of apples and barrels and autumn). The cider itself came out well, albeit a tad fizzier than intended. I sent it away to get bottled at a brewery in Stirling two days before Scotland went in to lockdown, which effectively meant that it had to sit in a tank at the brewery for a week or so longer that it was meant to. During this time it carried on fermenting and as the tank was pressurised it actually ended up carbonating itself (incidentally this is known as the Charmat method and is traditionally used to produce Prosecco). The cider itself came out rather well but it never really got the opportunity to surprise people in the way I wanted it to since all the pubs went and closed, instead it went predominantly to bottle shops who generally only cater to the more discerning end of the market anyway. So I’m aiming to do another batch of it for 2021, hopefully this time it will get into the hands of the Magners drinkers and set them on a fantastic full juice journey of discovery.</p>
                <img src="img/full.jpg" alt="cider" class="postimg">
                <p>The other thing we did for 2020 was increase the amount of limited edition 75cl’s, there were a couple of reasons for this. Firstly to get cider bottled at the brewery I need to put together a minimum of 1000 litres. The blends often don’t work out that way so I decided to bottle the smaller blends / experimental single casks myself in the cidery and the quickest way for me to do that is in 75cl bottles.</p>
                <p>The first of these was Craobh Làn which is quite possibly the best cider I’ve ever made. My only regret with it was the number of bottles that got broken in various depots and courier vans across the country as I tried to do online sales early in the lockdown. I abandoned the online shop after 4 weeks with just over 35% of all the orders being lost or broken. So that was definitely a lesson learned, quite an expensive one. The next release was meant to be Heavy Sun, which was a cask of the keeved cider that remained after the North and South blend. That was a particularly annoying batch because it sat there in the cask perfectly stable until June when I bottled it, a fortnight later it became apparent that it had restarted its fermentation and was on track to over carbonate itself, which would’ve resulted in gushes of white foam going everywhere once opened. Thankfully I had decided to keep it stashed away in the cidery until I was certain it was stable before selling, so I decanted the bottles back into the cask and let the fermentation finish off completely. I was more wary with the second cask I’d earmarked for Heavy Sun so I left it to sit in its barrel for even longer to make double sure that it wasn’t going to re-start in the bottle. I left this one until September and with no signs of it re-fermenting I went ahead and bottled it. That extra time spent through the summer led to pretty significant levels of malolactic fermentation lending to it a kind of savoury buttery flavour which I quite like but it possibly won’t be to everyone’s taste. The third 75cl release of 2020 was Islay Cask which is actually the only thing I released in 2020 that I had also done in 2019. I’m still figuring out how best to work with the smoky Islay casks, the 2019 vintage was much more acid driven attempting to play the smokiness off the lemony acidity as opposed to the 2018 which was more tannin driven and fizzier from the bottle conditioning, jury’s still out on which worked best. The 2020 iteration will be back to the tannins in the form of Major apples with extra juiciness from an extended maceration.

                <p>Another positive thing I can take from 2020 has been working with my cider distributors Grant (Re:Stalk) and Adam (Hard Pressed Cider) both of whom came to the rescue after the online sales debacle offering to take my cider palletised and get it around the country for me. Without them I think I would have had to drink about 4000 litres of cider myself which would have had a considerable impact on me both physically and financially, although I probably wouldn’t remember 2020 so every cloud I suppose. In fact without their work I doubt many of the people reading this blog would have ever got to try my cider at all so huge thanks to them!</p>
                <p>I’d also like to thank Adam Wells and James Finch for their support, excellent writing and fun videos, making the cider world seem bigger and yet closer all at the same time, the bubble is definitely growing. Also I feel like 2020 would’ve been even worse if it weren’t for all the team at The Neutral Cider Hotel spreading their cidery joy and goodness far and wide (Also, buy Ciderology by Gabe Cook…)</p>
                <p>So that was 2020, some good lessons learned and some great new friends made. Now let’s all really try to make 2021 something to remember!</p>
